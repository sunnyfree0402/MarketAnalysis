# Market Analysis

Implementing many different methods and popular analysis tools in Python. This repository is built with a particular bias for options and quantitative analysis. You can find lots of usable data and various algorithms to use in your own analysis. Also, feel free to contribute any methods that interest you. 

## Getting Started

Using a python3 environment, run the following to install all the libraries used in this repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Recommend using virtualenv to sandbox your work

### Manual Install 
Recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Anaconda does not come with TensorFlow or Keras so you will need to install those seperately. 
```
pip install pyex tensorflow keras
```
For additional information on installing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation), and [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html) 

If you do not wish to use Anaconda, the following should satisfy the requirements: 
```
pip install pyex pandas numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```
